# Project Overview

The system receives threat inputs from sensors embedded in soldiers' helmets on the battlefield. Threats identified as hostile are marked on a GPS map, along with the exact time the threat was detected. This feature allows soldiers to view enemy positions on the map, including the precise time hostile fire was detected.

By utilizing this system, soldiers can avoid potential threats, strategically plan their movements, and eliminate enemies from the air. Additionally, the map displays the locations of friendly forces, helping to prevent friendly fire.

## Key Features

* Dynamic Map Visualization: Highlights the soldier's location in yellow, while marking the locations of hostile fire detected by sensors in red.
* Real-Time Threat Tracking: Displays the exact time and location of detected threats, allowing soldiers to make informed decisions on the battlefield.
* Friendly Fire Prevention: Clearly marks the locations of friendly forces to reduce the risk of friendly fire incidents.
